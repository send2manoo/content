*Why should I have a website?*

**It’s hard to imagine anyone who wouldn’t benefit from having a website! You might need to display your portfolio for potential clients or employers. You might need to organize your projects in a way that you can share. You may want to create a blog about the things you’re doing or the places you’ve been. You might need to advertise yourself or your business or sell a product. Whatever your reason, there’s a good chance that you want to put something together without spending a ton of time on it. There’s an even better chance that you don’t want to spend a lot of money.**

***A website is a way to connect with the world and it’s a powerful tool for communication. It’s a way to share your work, your interests, and your passions. It’s how you can create, build, and control your online image. Plus, the sooner you build your site, the more time you’ll have to build your online presence and reach the people that you want to reach. It can help you stand out in a sea of competitors.
It’s also not the easiest thing to create if you don’t know what you’re doing!
There are a few ways that a beginner can create a simple and completely free website. The main ones are GitHub and Wordpress.***
